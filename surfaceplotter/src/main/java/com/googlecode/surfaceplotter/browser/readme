This is the JavaBrowser library written by Alexey Goloshubin and Jeremy Cook.
The library allows browsing of HTML files in a help system as a standalone
application, or from within another www browser that supports the applet tag.

IN the distribution you will find:

	./browser	A subdir containing the browser package
	./jb		A simple HTML browser which uses the package
	./doc		A subdir containing documentation in html

You can see a demo by accessing http://www.lstud.ii.uib.no/~s667/jb/

Compiling and running are straightforward - compile all java files
in browser and jb, then (on UNIX systems):

	setenv CLASSPATH "<this dir>:<this dir>/jb"
        cd doc
	java jb

then click reload and you are viewing the documentation.

The browser package implements a subset of HTML. Full documentation
of the implementation will be included soon, including better
instructions for building the package!

Please forward all improvements and bug fixes to the authors.
