  <h1>Surface Plotter - Mouse Operations</h1>
  <hr>
  Surface Plotter allows you rotate, scale, or move the surface plot
  by dragging mouse cursor over the image plus some keyboard key combinations.
  Mouse operations valid only when Surface Plotter is in surface plot mode.
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li>Drag the mouse cursor to <b>rotate</b> surface plot. The angle of 
      rotation depends on the delta of previous and current location of 
      mouse cursor. You can rotate the surface plot about the z axis 
      full 360 degrees, but elevation angle of the base plane is restricted
      to a value between 0 and 90 degrees.
  <li>Press and hold the <b>&lt;ctrl&gt;</b> button while dragging the mouse 
      cursor to <b>move</b> the surface plot. The amount of translation 
      depends on the delta of previous and current location of mouse cursor.
  <li>Press and hold the <b>&lt;shift&gt;</b> button while dragging the mouse 
      cursor to <b>scale</b> the surface plot. The change in scaling factor 
      depends on the delta of previous and current location of mouse cursor.
  </ul>
