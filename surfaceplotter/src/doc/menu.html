  <h1>Surface Plotter - Menu Commands</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3>Disabled Menus and Selections</h3>
  Menus and selections that are not currently available are disabled and can not 
  be selected.  Surface Plotter checks the version of the Java Virtual Machine 
  it is running on, and disables menus for functions that are not supported. 
  For example: if the Java Virtual Machine is of version older than 1.1, or 
  if Surface Plotter is running as an applet, Surface Plotter will disable the 
  "print" menu.
  <hr>
  <h3>File</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Open ...</b>
    <ul>Opens a Surface Plotter file. This menu is not available when
        running as an applet. (security restriction)</ul>
    <li><b>Save</b>
    <ul>Saves a Surface Plotter file. This menu is not available when
        running as an applet. (security restriction)</ul>
    <li><b>Save As ...</b>
    <ul>Saves a user specified Surface Plotter file. This menu is not 
        available when running as an applet. (security restriction)</ul>
    <li><b>Surface from Local Image File ...</b>
    <ul>Loads a local image file and creates a surface data from it.
        The image is automatically converted to gray scale image and is treated 
        as a 2.5 dimension data file. Black is converted to the lowest z level
        and white is converted to the highest z level. Surface Plotter displays
        <a href="imagetosurface.html">Image to Surface dialog box</a> and lets
        you enter conversion parameters before actually doing the conversion. 
        This menu is not available when running as an applet. 
        (security restriction)
    </ul>
    <li><b>Surface from Network Image File ...</b>
    <ul>Loads an image from network and creates a surface data from it.
        The image is automatically converted to gray scale image and is treated 
        as a 2.5 dimension data file. Black is converted to the lowest z level
        and white is converted to the highest z level. Surface Plotter displays
        <a href="imagetosurface.html">Image to Surface dialog box</a> and lets
        you enter conversion parameters before actually doing the conversion.
    </ul>
    <li><b>Print ...</b>
    <ul>Prints surface. This menu is not available when running as an applet 
        (security restriction) or when the version of Java Virtual Machine is
        less than 1.1</ul>
    <li><b>Exit/Close</b>
    <ul>Exits Surface Plotter (application) or closes the Surface Plotter frame
        (applet)</ul>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <h3>Edit</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Stretch Z Levels ...</b>
    <ul>Stretches Z levels of current surface data to new ranges.
        Surface Plotter displays <a href="stretchz.html">Stretch Z dialog box</a> 
        and lets you specify the stretching method and parameters before actually 
        doing the stretch.
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <h3>Options</h3>
  Menus that are in this group are all checkable menu items. You can 
  change a menu state by selecting the menu item. The following 
  describes a menu's function when it is checked:<p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Show Bounding Box</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to draw a bounding box for surface plot.</ul>
    <li><b>Show X-Y Mesh</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to draw the X-Y mesh of surface plot.</ul>
    <li><b>Show Face Grids</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to draw face grids.</ul>
    <li><b>Scale Bounding Box</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to scale bounding box to the proportion
        of variable ranges. Note that when one variable range is far greater 
        than other variable ranges, Surface Plotter will not scale the
        bounding box.
    </ul>
    <li><b>Show X-Y ticks</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to show the ticks of X and Y axes.</ul>
    <li><b>Show Z ticks</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to show the ticks of Z axis.</ul>
    <li><b>Wireframe Mode</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to show a surface as wireframe model.</ul>
    <li><b>Hidden Surface Elimination</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to eliminate invisible portions of a surface,
        but not to shade the surface.</ul>
    <li><b>Color Spectrum Mode</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to shade a surface with color function 
        that moves from violet to red as the z level increases.</ul>
    <li><b>Gray Scale Mode</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to shade a surface with color function 
        that moves from black to white as the z level increases.</ul>
    <li><b>Dual Shades Mode</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to shade surface of first function 
        with yellow and surface of second function with blue. The intensity
        of the shading colors increase as the z level increases.</ul>
    <li><b>Surface Plot</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to create surface plot of defined functions.</ul>
    <li><b>Contour Plot</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to create contour plot of a function.
        Only one function can be plotted in this mode, and the first function
        has higher priority.</ul>
    <li><b>Density Plot</b>
    <ul>Instructs Surface Plotter to create density plot of a function.
        Only one function can be plotted in this mode, and the first function
        has higher priority.</ul>
  </ul>
  <p>
