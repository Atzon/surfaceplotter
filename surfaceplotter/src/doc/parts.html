  <h2>The Function Panel</h2>
  <img src="images/functionpanel.gif" width=619 height=108 border=0><p>
  This panel is placed at the top of Surface Plotter frame. You can define
  your functions here. (See <a href="function.html">Function Syntax Reference</a>
  to learn on how to define a function) There are two text input fields 
  with a checkbox at the left side. The checkboxes are used to mark the functions 
  at the right "<b>active</b>". Surface Plotter evaluates only active functions when you 
  depress calculate button to start calculations, and plots only active functions. 
  You can have Surface Plotter evaluate two functions but plot only one of them 
  by checking both checkboxes before starting the calculations and
  unchecking one of them after Surface Plotter finished all calculations.
  Then, by checking and unchecking the checkboxes, you can switch the function
  to plot. If you checks both of them, Surface Plotter plots both of the 
  functions in the same object space, and you can see the intersection lines 
  of the two surfaces. Note that it is impossible to plot a function without
  first evaluates it, so if you didn't activate a function before starting
  calculations, Surface Plotter has no way to plot it after calculations.<p>
   
  There are also one checkbox labeled "delay regeneration" and a status line.
  When the checkbox is checked, Surface Plotter will not regenerate image 
  as you drag the image to rotate, scale, or move it. (see: mouse operations)
  Instead, Surface Plotter just display the position and direction of axes.
  This will dramatically reduce plotting time, especially when the surface
  to plot has huge number of sample points. The status line is straight-forward.
  It displays the current status of Surface Plotter.

  <h2>The Setting Panel</h2>

  This panel is placed below the function panel at the right side of Surface 
  Plotter frame. It contains four command buttons and several input fields.<p>
  The four buttons and their functionalities are:

  <ul>
    <li><b>Calculate</b><br>
    Instructs Surface Plotter to clear current internal surface data dan
    start a new calculation session. Surface Plotter evaluates only active
    functions, but you will lose all surface data of the previous session.<p>

    <li><b>Stop</b><br>
    Instructs Surface Plotter to stop all background activities in progress.
    This will interrupt the surface rendering process and the calculations.
    This is an interrupt/abort buttton, not a cancel button. Because Surface 
    Plotter clears surface data before doing calculations, you will have no 
    surface data to plot if you interrupt calculations.<p>

    <li><b>Regenerate</b><br>
    Instructs Surface Plotter to regenerate image. You need this button when
    you changed the z range or the number contour lines, or when you need
    to refresh Surface Plotter<p>

    <li><b>Rotate/Freeze</b><br>
    Automatically rotates the displayed surface. When you depress the "rotate"
    button, the label of the button will change to "freeze". Depressing the
    "freeze" button will stop automatic rotation. You can only rotates surface
    plots, not contour plots nor density plots. (see: menu|options)<p>
  </ul>

  The input fields and their functionalities are:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Divisions</b><br>
    The number of divisions to be calculated and to be displayed. In wireframe mode, 
    Surface Plotter uses both "calculate" and "display" values to generate surface plot.<p>

    <li><b>Minimums/Maximums</b><br>
    The minimum and maximum values of x, y, and z variables. Only x and y ranges update 
    needs recalculation. Surface Plotter displays the minimum and maximum values of 
    calculated z. Use these values to update the z variable range and depress the 
    regenerate button to regenerate image.<p>
    
    <li><b>Contours</b><br>
    The number of contour lines to display in contour plot. If you change this value,
    you need to depress the regenerate button to take the change into effect.
    This value also affect the z legend of density plot.<p>
  </ul>
