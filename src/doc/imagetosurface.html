  <h1>Image to Surface Dialog Box</h1>

  Surface Plotter displays this dialog box after completely loaded an
  image (from a local disk or from network). The above image is a screen
  shot of this dialog box on Windows 95 (tm) platform. 
  There are four buttons (+1, +10, -10, -1) that allow you change the 
  number of divisions to be made on surface during conversion. Surface 
  Plotter displays vertical and horizontal lines in red and will convert 
  only pixels on the intersections of the lines. The more the number of 
  divisions is, the smoother the surface will be, but the overall process 
  becomes slower.<p>
  There is also a special button <b>invert</b> useful to invert the colors 
  of image being displayed.<p>
  
  The conversion follows these rules:<p>
  <ul>
  <li>The axes origin is set to the center of the image.
  <li>X axis is placed  horizontally, with positive x points to the right 
      side of the image.
  <li>Y axis is placed vertically, with positive y points to the top side
      of the image.
  <li>If the width and the height of the image are different, Surface Plotter
      chooses the shorter one and converts it to a range -1..+1. The other
      one will be converted to a proportional range. If your image's height is
      twice of its width, the x range will become -1..+1 and the y range will
      become -2..+2. 
  <li>The Z level is always in the range 0..+1. You can change
      this range after the conversion using the Edit|Stretch Z Levels menu.
